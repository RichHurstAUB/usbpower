This program lets you send suspend or resume commands to any USB device.
These are the commands used if your computer goes to sleep; they 
essentially turn off and on the device.

For example, if you use this command to suspend your mouse, you'll see its
light go off (and it will obviously stop working). When you resume it, the
light will go back on (and it will start working).

It is probably not a good idea to suspend your keyboard as you may have
some trouble resuming it again.

There are also other devices which it might be inadvisable to suspend
(such as a USB disk drive you're currently using). Use this software 
at your own risk.
